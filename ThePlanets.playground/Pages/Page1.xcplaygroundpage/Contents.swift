 # The Planets
 
Hello my name is Ronaldo, I am a student at the Apple Developer Academy and majoring in Computer Science at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Cear√°. I have astronomy as a passion and encouraged by my little cousin, who has the dream of strolling around the planets, I decided to approach this theme in this playground, which aims to teach astronomy to children, through curious facts and real images of the planets of the solar system. All images were taken from nasa's website and are in the public domain
