Hello traveler, welcome to the solar system. Right now you and your crew member Joel Levi are in orbit. The solar system is inside a huge galaxy, called the milky way. The solar system has as its biggest star, the Sun, a red giant about 4.6 billion years old !!. Your objective is to show this little and curious boy all the facts and information about the 8 planets that are part of this system.
First let's look at the names of the planets and some messages that they sent us.
